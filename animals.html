                <h1>Cat</h1>
                <p>The wildcat and the other members of the cat family had a common ancestor about 10â€“15 million years ago. 
                    The European wildcat evolved during the Cromerian Stage about 866,000 to 478,000 years ago; 
                    its direct ancestor was Felis lunensis.
                    The silvestris and lybica lineages probably diverged about 173,000 years ago.</p>

                <h1>Eagle</h1>
                <p>Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. 
                    Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. 
                    The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than the male. 
                    The parents take no action to stop the killing.</p>

                <h1>Owl</h1>
                <p>All owls are carnivorous birds of prey and live mainly on a diet of insects and small rodents such as mice, rats, and hares. 
                    Some owls are also specifically adapted to hunt fish.
                    They are very adept in hunting in their respective environments.
                    Since owls can be found in nearly all parts of the world and across a multitude of ecosystems, their hunting skills and 
                    characteristics vary slightly from species to species, though most characteristics are shared among all species.</p>

                <h1>Polar Bear</h1>
                <p>Because of expected habitat loss caused by climate change, the polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species. 
                    For decades, large-scale hunting raised international concern for the future of the species, 
                    but populations rebounded after controls and quotas began to take effect.</p>

                <h1>Wolf</h1>
                <p>The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis species, 
                    such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile hybrids with them.
                    The banded fur of a wolf is usually mottled white, brown, gray, and black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all white.</p>
